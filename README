This is the official SexpCode plug-in for WordPress.
It implements the complete spec detailed at http://cairnarvon.rotahall.org/misc/sexpcode.html , except for the optional img function.

New features will be added as #bbcode straightens out the SexpCode spec.


To install this plug-in, simply upload sexpcode.php to your /wp-content/plugins/ folder and activate it from your WP Admin panel.
